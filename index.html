            <a href="http://www.html-5-tutorial.com/"><img class="html5" src="assets/images/html5.png" alt="html-5-tutorial.com" width="900px" height="700px"></a>
            <p>Today I finished the tutorial that Duncan Aitken had created on a website called <a href="http://www.html-5-tutorial.com/">html-5-tutorial</a> that is dedicated to teaching <strong>HTML5</strong>.</p>
            <p>I found the material very easy to digest such as the language was conversational while being highly informative.</p>
            <p>Aitken does a great job explaining that a website has two types of audience that will visit your website. Such as normal human visitors as well as spiders or bots (for example: Googlebot). He also goes into detail on how to layout your website for SEO purposes. Check out his website if you're interested!</p>
